## Project
The project consists of 4 parts: web, backend, node.js api, python api. Coded for master's thesis. It is based on the comparison of data collected from the real environment and data generated by the simulator with deep learning algorithms. As a result, it was observed that the simulator data was close to the real environment data. On the web project, there are screens such as entering real world data, creating simulator data, adding error types for the simulator, running the algorithm with the data set and comparing the algorithm results.
